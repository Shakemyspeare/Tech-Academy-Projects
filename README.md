# Contoso_University_MVC

C# MVC tutorial. Through this tutorial I was able to excersise and deepen my knowledge of not only C#, but also the MVC Framework. 

This project concerned creating a wedsite that allowed to sign in, instructors to choose the courses they are teaching, and add additional courses for future use.

Students, instructors, and departments are able to add, delete, and edit their descriptions and settings.
